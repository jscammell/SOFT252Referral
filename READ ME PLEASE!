SOFT252 Patient_management_system is an old version done on apache 
netbeans 11.2 so has all my commits and shows
constant updates of my work.

However I recal the use of NetBeans 8.2 so i switched over and copied my
files accross to the new one but still kept the old version because i needed to show my
constant commits to github.

There is an Error in Secretary_GUI that I beleive is a netbeans error and not a coding error and therefore cannot find a fix for it.
the error is as follows:
"Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.ClassCastException: User.Patient cannot be cast to Processes.Appointment"
